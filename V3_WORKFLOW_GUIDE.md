## Boot Sequence

This is the correct startup order. Each step depends on the one before it.

### Step 1 — Initialize Claude Flow

This creates the `.claude-flow/` workspace config and `.swarm/` directory.

```bash
cf-init
```

> "Initialize Claude Flow in this workspace with default settings"

> "Run the Claude Flow wizard to configure topology, memory, and agent preferences interactively"

Use `cf-wizard` for guided setup, or `cf-init` for defaults.

### Step 2 — Verify Environment

```bash
cf-doctor
```

> "Run Claude Flow doctor to check that everything is healthy — node version, npm globals, MCP connectivity, memory status"

Fix any issues before proceeding.

### Step 3 — Initialize Memory

Claude Flow's memory is SQLite-based at `.swarm/memory.db`. It doesn't exist until you initialize it.

```bash
npx -y claude-flow@alpha memory init
```

Configure retention and limits:

```bash
npx -y claude-flow@alpha config set memory.retention 30d
npx -y claude-flow@alpha config set memory.maxSize 1GB
```

> "Initialize the Claude Flow memory system and set retention to 30 days"

### Step 4 — Register MCP Servers

Claude Flow and AgentDB each run as separate MCP servers. Claude Code can't use their tools until they're registered.

**Claude Flow MCP** (gives Claude Code access to swarm, memory, browser, hooks, neural tools):

```bash
claude mcp add claude-flow -- npx -y claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

**AgentDB MCP** (gives Claude Code semantic vector search via HNSW):

```bash
claude mcp add agentdb -- npx -y agentdb mcp
```

Verify both are running:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

> "Register Claude Flow and AgentDB as MCP servers, then verify both are connected"

### Step 5 — Activate RuVector Hooks

RuVector is the neural learning engine. It hooks into Claude Flow to learn from your edits, route tasks intelligently, and remember successful patterns. It doesn't activate until you initialize the hooks.

```bash
ruv-init
```

For existing projects, pretrain from the codebase so RuVector already knows your patterns:

```bash
hooks-train
```

> "Initialize RuVector hooks and pretrain the intelligence from the existing codebase"

### Step 6 — Start the Daemon

The daemon runs background workers for monitoring, session persistence, and security auditing.

```bash
cf-daemon
```

> "Start the Claude Flow daemon for background processing"

### Step 7 — Verify Everything

```bash
turbo-status
mem-stats
hooks-intel
claude mcp list
```

> "Show me the full system status — installed components, memory statistics, hooks intelligence status, and active MCP servers"

**You're now fully booted.** Memory is live, RuVector is learning, both MCP servers are registered, daemon is running.

## Boot Sequence (Quick Copy-Paste)

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
cf-init
cf-doctor
npx -y claude-flow@alpha memory init
npx -y claude-flow@alpha config set memory.retention 30d
claude mcp add claude-flow -- npx -y claude-flow@alpha mcp start
claude mcp add agentdb -- npx -y agentdb mcp
ruv-init
hooks-train
cf-daemon
turbo-status
```

## Three Memory Systems

You have three distinct memory layers. They serve different purposes.

| System | What it does | How to use |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Claude Flow Memory** (mem-*) | Key-value + vector search in SQLite. Stores project config, agent state, task context. Built into Claude Flow. | `mem-store`, `mem-search`, `mem-vsearch` |
| **RuVector** (ruv-*) | Neural pattern learning. Watches your edits, learns what works, routes tasks to best agents. Hooks into Claude Flow. | `ruv-remember`, `ruv-recall`, `ruv-route` |
| **AgentDB** (agentdb-*) | Standalone HNSW vector database. Semantic search across documents and embeddings. Runs as its own MCP server. | `agentdb-store`, `agentdb-query` via MCP |

### When to use which:

- **Storing project configuration or task state** → Claude Flow memory (`mem-store`)
- **Remembering a coding pattern that worked** → RuVector (`ruv-remember`)
- **Storing documents for semantic RAG search** → AgentDB (via MCP tools)
- **Finding which agent is best for a task** → RuVector routing (`ruv-route`)
- **Searching memory by keyword** → Claude Flow (`mem-search`)
- **Searching memory by meaning** → AgentDB (`agentdb_query` MCP tool) or Claude Flow (`mem-vsearch`)
